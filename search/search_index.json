There was a whisper in an unknown tongue. The stone said: \u201cI know not your words, but I know your warmth...\u201d \u2014 and then enhanced their Firebolt. The anthracite statue holding the candle cracked and glowed, mirroring the fire goblins themselves.  </p> <p>The final agreement: one wagonload of coal, given freely, in return for ten percent of \u201ceverything the heat of that coal touches\u201d \u2014 a symbolic gesture more than a literal tithe. It also includes a mutual defense pact: the clan will come to Marrowfen\u2019s aid in times of need, just as Marrowfen is bound to answer the clan\u2019s call.</p> <p>The session closed with discussions of irrigation and sustainable farming.
