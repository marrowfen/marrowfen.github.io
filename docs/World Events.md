# Events

This system introduces dynamic conditions that influence the environment, resource availability, and labor effectiveness in Marrowfen. These represent changes in weather, wildlife activity, settler morale, and supply conditions, shaping the world session by session.

## üåÄ How It Works

Before each session‚Äîor at the start of a long-term project phase‚Äîroll or select an active event. These events may impact:

- **Travel time** (overland or river routes)
- **Wildlife behavior** (including risk of encounters or hunting difficulty)
- **Skill check modifiers** (bonuses or penalties)
- **Task efficiency** (how many tasks can be completed, or how well they're done)

Multiple events can apply at once if circumstances call for it (e.g., a storm during a period of unrest).

## üå§Ô∏è Weather Events (1d8)

| Event               | Effects                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clear & Calm**    | Normal conditions. No adjustments.                                                                     |
| **Light Rain**      | Slightly muddy ground slows travel. -2 to Survival; building outdoors takes longer.                    |
| **Heavy Rain**      | Roads flood. Travel takes twice as long. Outdoor tasks are delayed or fail without cover.              |
| **Fog**             | Visibility is limited. Travel speed halved. Navigation and ranged checks suffer -5.                    |
| **Strong Winds**    | Travel on open water is dangerous. Climbing, roofing, and scaffolding work suffers disadvantage.       |
| **Sunny & Dry**     | Travel is faster by land (+25%). Drying/crafting tasks complete more quickly.                          |
| **Frozen Ground**   | Digging and construction involving earth are slowed. Mold Earth may fail; +10 travel time across dirt. |
| **Overcast & Cool** | Longer work shifts possible, but -5 to Constitution saves during extended labor (optional).            |

## üßç Social & Morale Events

| Event                       | Effects                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Inspired Settlers**       | All labor checks gain +1d4; one task may be automatically completed each phase.      |
| **Festival Hangover**       | All tasks suffer -2 on the first day; -1 on the second. Travel prep is slower.       |
| **Conflict Among Laborers** | Every labor phase rolls for a minor complication (e.g., disagreement, accident).     |
| **Skilled Visitor**         | Once per phase, a task matching the visitor‚Äôs expertise gains advantage.             |
| **Volunteer Surge**         | One minor task completes for free per phase (extra hands available).                 |
| **Resource Hoarding**       | Supplies are guarded or missing. Tasks requiring materials take longer to start.     |
| **Labor Shortage**          | One fewer helper may be assigned to tasks this phase. Delays in multi-step projects. |

## üåø Environmental Events

| Event               | Effects                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Animal Activity** | Wildlife is restless. Outdoor tasks have a 1-in-6 chance of interruption. Hunting is harder.                             |
| **Blooming Season** | +2 to Herbalism/Nature. Settlers are in better spirits when surrounded by flowers.                                       |
| **Insect Swarms**   | Visibility reduced in swarms. -5 to Perception. Laborers must make Con saves or work half as long.                       |
| **River Swells**    | Ferries and bridges are risky. Travel via water takes longer or may be blocked. Water-based spells enhanced.             |
| **Dry Season**      | Woodcrafting is easier. +2 to splitting/gathering logs. Fire risk: rolling a 1 while near flame may ignite surroundings. |

## Marrowfen River State Table

The river is a lifeline and a hazard. Its behavior reflects conditions far upstream ‚Äî melting snow, storms, or dry spells ‚Äî and it may shift dramatically between sessions.

**Roll or choose a river state** at the start of the session or travel phase. This modifies water-based travel, nearby terrain, and access to river resources.

## üõ∂ River Conditions (1d8)

|River State|Description & Effects|
|---|---|
|**1. Low & Lazy**|Water is slow and shallow. Boats may run aground; navigation easy. Fishing is poor (-2). River crossings possible by foot in some areas.|
|**2. Normal Flow**|Average depth and speed. Travel and construction proceed without penalty.|
|**3. Dry Banks**|Recent drought. River is unusually narrow. Foraging from riverbanks is easier (+2 to Survival), but ferry routes are blocked.|
|**4. Choked with Debris**|Flooded upstream forest sent branches and silt downriver. Boat travel is slowed (double time); Masonry and repairs near water suffer -2.|
|**5. Swollen Current**|Faster, deeper flow. Ferry travel takes half the time but is risky (Dex save or skill check may be needed). Shoreline tasks are hazardous.|
|**6. Rushing Waters**|Strong current threatens to wash away docks or boats. Riverbank paths may be unsafe. Any structure near water must be checked for damage.|
|**7. Flooded Banks**|Water overruns low ground. Paths and camps near the river are submerged. Travel takes longer (rerouting needed), and disease risk rises.|
|**8. Torrential Surge**|A surge from upstream rains. No ferry travel possible. Risk of flash flooding (Dex saves or Strength checks to secure supplies). All riverside construction halts.|

## üå± DM Tips:

- River events **stack** with weather. A calm day doesn‚Äôt guarantee a safe river.
- Combine river and environmental effects for challenge: e.g., **Fog + Rushing Waters = zero visibility + risky crossings**.
- Let players gather clues from locals or nature checks to predict future river states.

This makes the river feel like a living force in Marrowfen ‚Äî a moody thread through the world that demands respect.
