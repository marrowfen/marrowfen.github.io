## Mission Title: Dreamroot

**Summary:** Wren Greaves has gone missing. The players track her to a bioluminescent cave where she's found lying unconscious, her body entwined with glowing mycelium. A circle of Myconids watches over her, silent and still. To reach her mind and bring her back, the players must inhale Myconid spores and enter the shared dream-world known to the Myconids as the Spore Chorus. However, the Chorus is no longer stable — Wren's unconscious mind has reshaped the dream realm, causing chaos within the hive's usually tranquil network.

### ACT 1: The Physical World

- **Hook:** Wren left her bracelet in a bug trap near the tavern. Her tracks lead through mud and reeds toward the misty cave.
- **Cave Features:**
    - Spore clouds shimmer in the air
    - Wren lies nestled in a cradle of glowing mycelium
    - Myconids (5 adults, 1 sovereign) line the walls, unmoving
- **Interaction:**
    - The sovereign exhales spores inviting the players to join the Chorus
    - Refusal = no progress; forceful attempt results in psychic backlash from the hive

### ACT 2: The Spore Chorus (Dream World)

- **Tone:** Surreal, unstable, child-influenced chaos
- **Visuals:** Crayon-like forests, floating frogs, twisting paths, dream-logic shifts

**Key Locations:**

#### The Memory Meadow
Features a strange puppet theater reenacting nonsensical children's tales. Each tale is out of order or scrambled. Players must restore the proper sequence based on obscure narrative logic (e.g., "The Frog Who Ate the Moon," "Why Rain Hates Hats," "The Beetle and the Broken Bell").

#### Clockwork Orchard
Wren’s fears manifested as broken toys and sparking gadgets block the path. Players must use creative thinking or empathy to disarm them (e.g., finding the key that isn't a key, or singing a lullaby to stop a toy from shaking).

#### The Whispering Library
A library that stretches as far as the eyes can see, all of the books are in place neatly on the shelves except for 4 books which are laying in the middle of the floor.

Looking around the players see a spot on one of the shelves for 4 books to be placed side by side. 

The books must be placed in the correct order on the shelf. There are a few hints in the book titles to help guide the players toward the solution.  

The four books on the floor are:
          "Robby Fox Finds Their Pounce" (Summer)
          "Nina Hare Buys a New Coat" (Winter)
          "Why Rebecca Raven Built a Nest on a Treant" (Spring)
          "Erik Bear Packs His Belly" (Autumn)
  
When placed in the right order, the library will explode in a flurry of activity as all the books jump off the shelf and flap away like birds, one of the book birds will drop the last part of the bracelet. 

After the birds fly away the library will fade away, to show the real Wren laying in an open meadow, lots of insects, amphibians and animals standing in a circle around her, they will all look to the players with pleading eyes.  


#### Characters:

- **Wren (dream-avatar):** Appears differently in each area — joyful child, silent observer, or frightened shadow
- **Bloomroot (dream-form):** Now fractured; trapped within a maze of Wren’s dreams and unable to assert control

---

**Objectives:**

- **Restore Harmony to the Chorus**
    - Solve all three dream puzzles
    - Each success stabilizes an area and gives more clarity
    - Final challenge: Reconnect Wren with her core self in a symbolic act (e.g., return her bracelet, fix a broken toy, relight a fading lantern)
- **Failure State:**
    - Too many failures result in ejection from the Chorus, requiring a new approach or future retry

---

**Mechanics:**
- No combat
- Each puzzle can be approached multiple ways (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)
- Encourage creative, symbolic solutions — players who connect emotionally gain advantage

---

### ACT 3: Waking

- If successful, players wake Wren and themselves
- Wren has vague recollection, emotionally uplifted — she’s more vibrant, imaginative, and full of wonder
- The Myconids are grateful, offering continued peace and slow-growing trust

---

**Rewards:**

- Wren safe: Morale +1 in town
- Alliance: Access to Myconid goods (healing spores, dyes, reagents)
- Dreamroot Spores (rare item, used in divination or crafting insight-enhancing tea)
- Optional: One PC gains a subtle psychic link to Wren or residual dream echoes

---

**DM Notes:**

- Keep tone whimsical but unsettling
- Use childlike logic and broken metaphors in puzzles
- Players must solve puzzles without knowing Wren's past; lean into strange stories and abstract resolutions
- Let players fail forward — small missteps lead to new layers, not dead ends

---

**End of Session Hook:**  
As the dream fades, a chorus of childlike laughter echoes, and one word lingers in the minds of every player: _"Shine."_
