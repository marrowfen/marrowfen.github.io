**Mission Title:** Dreamroot

**Summary:** Wren Greaves has gone missing. The players track her to a bioluminescent cave where she's found lying unconscious, her body entwined with glowing mycelium. A circle of Myconids watches over her, silent and still. To reach her mind and bring her back, the players must inhale Myconid spores and enter the shared dream-world known to the Myconids as the Spore Chorus. However, the Chorus is no longer stable — Wren's unconscious mind has reshaped the dream realm, causing chaos within the hive's usually tranquil network.

**ACT 1: The Physical World**

- **Hook:** Wren left her bracelet in a bug trap near the tavern. Her tracks lead through mud and reeds toward the misty cave.
    
- **Cave Features:**
    
    - Spore clouds shimmer in the air
        
    - Wren lies nestled in a cradle of glowing mycelium
        
    - Myconids (5 adults, 1 sovereign) line the walls, unmoving
        
- **Interaction:**
    
    - The sovereign exhales spores inviting the players to join the Chorus
        
    - Refusal = no progress; forceful attempt results in psychic backlash from the hive

**ACT 2: The Spore Chorus (Dream World)**

- **Tone:** Surreal, unstable, child-influenced chaos
    
- **Visuals:** Crayon-like forests, floating frogs, twisting paths, dream-logic shifts
    

**Key Locations:**

1. **The Memory Meadow** – Features a strange puppet theater reenacting nonsensical children's tales. Each tale is out of order or scrambled. Players must restore the proper sequence based on obscure narrative logic (e.g., "The Frog Who Ate the Moon," "Why Rain Hates Hats," "The Beetle and the Broken Bell").
    
2. **Clockwork Orchard** – Wren’s fears manifested as broken toys and sparking gadgets block the path. Players must use creative thinking or empathy to disarm them (e.g., finding the key that isn't a key, or singing a lullaby to stop a toy from shaking).
    
3. **The Whispering Library** – Shelves of talking books that offer riddles. Some lie, some tell nonsense, and some tell the truth in backwards rhyme.
    

**Puzzle Framework:**

- **Goal:** Stabilize the Chorus by restoring balance to three dream nodes
    
- **Puzzle Types:**
    
    - Child Story Reconstruction (sequence nonsensical stories using abstract logic)
        
    - Logic Riddles from dream entities
        
    - Emotional Symbol Matching (fears and hopes visualized in surreal objects)
        

**Characters:**

- **Wren (dream-avatar):** Appears differently in each area — joyful child, silent observer, or frightened shadow
    
- **Bloomroot (dream-form):** Now fractured; trapped within a maze of Wren’s dreams and unable to assert control
    

---

**Objectives:**

- **Restore Harmony to the Chorus**
    
    - Solve all three dream puzzles
        
    - Each success stabilizes an area and gives more clarity
        
    - Final challn with her coreenge: Reconnect Wre self in a symbolic act (e.g., return her bracelet, fix a broken toy, relight a fading lantern)
        
- **Failure State:**
    
    - Too many failures result in ejection from the Chorus, requiring a new approach or future retry
        

---

**Mechanics:**

- No combat
    
- Each puzzle can be approached multiple ways (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)
    
- Encourage creative, symbolic solutions — players who connect emotionally gain advantage
    

---

**ACT 3: Waking**

- If successful, players wake Wren and themselves
    
- Wren has vague recollection, emotionally uplifted — she’s more vibrant, imaginative, and full of wonder
    
- The Myconids are grateful, offering continued peace and slow-growing trust
    

---

**Rewards:**

- Wren safe: Morale +1 in town
    
- Alliance: Access to Myconid goods (healing spores, dyes, reagents)
    
- Dreamroot Spores (rare item, used in divination or crafting insight-enhancing tea)
    
- Optional: One PC gains a subtle psychic link to Wren or residual dream echoes
    

---

**DM Notes:**

- Keep tone whimsical but unsettling
    
- Use childlike logic and broken metaphors in puzzles
    
- Players must solve puzzles without knowing Wren's past; lean into strange stories and abstract resolutions
    
- Let players fail forward — small missteps lead to new layers, not dead ends

****End of Session Hook:** As the dream fades, a chorus of childlike laughter echoes, and one word lingers in the minds of every player: _"Shine."_
