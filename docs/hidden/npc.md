### 🧑‍🌾 Settlement NPCs (Males)

#### Hale Vayne – Weathered Woodsman  
(Athletics, Survival, Carpenter’s Tools)
 Broad-shouldered and stone-quiet, Hale Vayne looks like he’s been in more fights with trees than people — and lost none of them. His face bears a thick scar like a snapped branch, and his clothes smell of pine, sweat, and leather. He built his hide-and-rope tent from scratch and sleeps in it boots on, blade nearby. If he says more than three words, something’s wrong.
- Broad-shouldered and quiet
- Clears trees like he’s in a fistfight with the forest.
- Sleeps with his boots on
- Has an old scar shaped like a branch across his face
- Built his own tent out of stitched hide and rope

#### Bram Tallowfoot – Jolly Camp Builder  
(Carpenter’s Tools, Performance)
A round-bellied human with curly hair and a belly laugh louder than a war drum, Bram keeps the camp upright in both spirit and structure. With a whistle in his beard and a song in his lungs, he builds with a kind of instinctive grace that turns timber into homes. Known for once wrestling a boar and apologizing to it, Bram is beloved, dependable, and occasionally tipsy on berry wine.
- Round-bellied human with curly hair
- Singing voice better than any bard you’ve heard
- Can measure, cut, and join timber without looking
- Keeps a wood-carved flute in his belt
- Once wrestled a boar into submission (and apologized to it after)
#### Thorn Barrow – Retired Soldier, Reluctant Farmer  
(Athletics, Survival, Mason’s Tools)
With a single eye and a perpetual scowl, Thorn Barrow plants vegetables like he’s laying siege. Everything he does has a soldier’s precision — from trench-digging to militia drills to sharpening his shovel “just in case.” He rarely speaks unless it’s a correction, a warning, or the word “No.” Yet behind the crust, there’s a loyalty as strong as steel… and a soft spot only his grandson ever sees.
- Gruff and one-eyed
- Thorn’s idea of “light conversation” is naming all the ways a shovel can kill.
- Digs trenches and foundations like he’s back in the war
- Trains anyone who asks — or annoys him enough
- Sleeps upright with a sword on his chest
#### Corwin Greaves – Aspiring Inventor  
(Tinker’s Tools, Smith’s Tools, Arcana)
Corwin is a lanky, soot-smudged tinker with bright ideas and burn marks to prove it. His eyes dart from gear to gear as though already building something in his head. Known for his madcap designs — some brilliant, some explosive — he never eats the same meal twice and always smells like burnt copper. His fingers are calloused, his hair wild, and his dreams bigger than the camp itself.
- Tall, twitchy man with soot-stained gloves and big dreams
- His contraptions usually work. Eventually
- Has drawn up a mechanical well, pulley crane, and exploding wheelbarrow    
- Never eats the same thing twice
- Always smells faintly of burnt copper

  

### 🧑‍🌾 Settlement NPCs (Females)

#### Nira Vayne – Witchy Healer & Soft-Spoken Shield  
(Medicine, Herbalism Kit, Arcana)
Nira Vayne is calm as still water and sharp as its undertow. Married to the gruff Hale, she’s the quiet force who binds the camp together — sometimes with stitches, sometimes with whispered curses. Always up before dawn, she moves with purpose, herbs swaying at her hip. Children cling to her skirts, and strangers feel their hair rise under her gaze. If you’ve crossed her, you’ll know. If you’re under her care, you’ll be safe.
- Married to Hale.
- Soft voice, calloused hands
- Knows how to stitch a wound and lay a curse — and sometimes does both at once
- Wears a bundle of herbs on her hip like a weapon
- Sleeps beside the fire but wakes before the dawn 
- Protective of the camp’s children, wary of strangers
#### Merribelle Tallowfoot – Cook, Gossip, Knife Collector  
(Cook’s Utensils, Insight, Water Vehicles)
Merribelle is half the size of her stew pot and twice as sharp as any of her seventeen named knives. With a booming voice, a belly laugh, and a glare that could curdle milk, she keeps the camp fed, informed, and in line. Call her “ma’am” and you’re fine. Call her “little lady” and you’ll meet “Butterstick” — her favorite paring knife. She knows every secret whispered in sleep and who’s been sneaking second helpings.
- Bram’s wife
- Tiny human with a personality three times her size
- She knows who’s sleeping where and what they said in their sleep
- Wonderful fisherwoman, knows this area of the river like the back of her hand
- Owns 17 knives and names each one
- Calls everyone “honey” or “bastard,” depending on the day
- Keeps the camp running on stew, spite, and strong drink
#### Elka Redfern – Marshland Tracker & Hunter  
(Survival, Stealth, Nature, Herbalism Kit)
Elka moves like smoke through reeds, silent and watching. Her hood of crow feathers and cloak of oiled hide speak of skill and survival more than fashion. She smells of peat and ash, and her voice comes low and slow — if it comes at all. Each tooth or talon she carries is a story of something that didn’t walk away. People are tolerated. Dogs are loved. And fences? Those are challenges.
- Lean, sharp-eyed, and always smelling faintly of bogwater and smoke.
- Elka doesn't speak unless it's necessary — and when she does, it's usually a warning.
- Hunts by bow, trap, or knife depending on the prey
- Wears a hood stitched from crow feathers and waterproofed with fat
- Carries trophies from every creature she’s bested — including a broken wyvern fang
- Keeps to the outer woods, but always returns to share meat or news
- Hates fences, loves dogs, tolerates people

  

### 🧑‍🌾 Settlement NPCs (Children)

#### Wren Greaves – Tinker's Daughter, Marsh Sneaker  
(Tinker’s Tools (basic), Stealth, Survival)
 Eight years old and too clever by half, Wren darts through the reeds like a breeze through chimes. With copper-scented fingers and moss-streaked legs, she builds traps for bugs and chats with frogs like old friends. She’s barefoot, bold, and just as likely to vanish into a thicket as to turn up holding a clockwork thing she shouldn’t have. Her father’s inventions are dangerous. Wren is worse.
A wiry girl of about 8 with wind-tangled hair and a knack for disappearing into places she shouldn’t be.
- Daughter of Corwin Greaves (the aspiring inventor)
- Usually barefoot, usually muddy
- Builds bird traps and bug jars out of scrap wood and twine
- Talks to frogs like they’re people — and says they talk back
- Always smells faintly of copper and moss
- Once accidentally activated one of her father’s prototypes; nearly glided into the river

#### Tomlin Barrow – Thorn’s Grandson, Strong & Small  
(Perception, Athletics (low), Insight)
Round-faced and wide-eyed, Tomlin marches through camp like he owns it — or at least guards it. With his wooden sword “Ser Fang” always at his side and a scowl that doesn’t quite hide his curiosity, he takes his job seriously: protecting Marrowfen, following Thorn’s example, and learning “village protocol.” He’s seven, rarely smiles, and tries to correct adults in his best soldier voice. It’s adorable. He’d hate that you said that.
Round-faced and serious, Tomlin (age 9) tries to act older than he is — mostly because he's being raised by Thorn Barrow.
- Grandson of Thorn Barrow
- Carries a wooden practice sword and calls it “Ser Fang”
- Wakes up early to do “guard duty” by watching the eastern trail
- Hates baths, loves stew, fears the sound of owls
- Quiet but observant — he often notices what adults miss
- Wants to grow up to be “just like Grampa, but maybe smile more”

Tomlin looks up to Thorn and mimics him constantly. He often sits in on militia drills or chores, and sometimes tries to correct grownups on “village protocol.”

### 🧑‍🌾 Settlement NPCs (Lord)

#### Name: Lord Aedric Solmere – Crown’s Delegate to Marrowfen
Description: A seasoned nobleman with a stern bearing and eyes that weigh every word spoken around him, Lord Aedric Solmere serves as the crown’s appointed overseer of Marrowfen. Though he does not reside in the settlement, his visits are rare but memorable — each one bringing orders, expectations, and a palpable tension. Cloaked in red and fur, marked by the golden sunburst of his station, Aedric is a man of legacy, leverage, and long memory. His loyalty to the crown is absolute… but his gaze always calculates what might come next.

#### Name: Sir Calros Veyne – Blade of the Outer Watch  
Description: Clad in gleaming half-plate and unflinching pride, Sir Calros is the very image of disciplined service. A knight of lesser title, he swore fealty to House Solmere years ago and has since acted as their visible blade and shield. His sense of duty is unwavering, his speech clipped and formal. While he might seem rigid, those who fight beside him know they are safe until his final breath.

#### Name: Lys Marrin – Shieldmaiden of Solmere  
Description: Stoic and swift, Lys bears the lion sigil of House Solmere with pride etched into every motion. Her armor is lighter than her peers’, built for movement — perfect for intercepting threats before they ever near the lord. Beneath her helmet, sharp eyes scan constantly. She rarely speaks unless reporting, but when she does, her words land like thrown daggers. Rumors claim she once disarmed three men before breakfast. She neither confirms nor denies.

#### Name: Breccan Thorne – Halberdier of the Royal Guard  
Description: Broad-shouldered and quiet as snowfall, Breccan stands like a wall wherever Lord Solmere goes. His halberd is always polished, his boots always muddy, and his answers rarely exceed five words. A former stonecutter turned soldier, he brings unshakable focus and brutal efficiency to his post. He’s not here to talk. He’s here to stand, watch, and break whatever tries to pass.

#### Name: Breccan Thorne – Halberdier of the Royal Guard  
Description: Breccan is a cheerful ox of a man — big laugh, bigger voice, and the kind of grip that cracks walnuts just by holding them. Once a stonemason, now a proud guard, he chats with townsfolk, hums old tavern songs on watch, and always remembers faces. His halberd is more polished than his boots, and his stories are taller than his posture. But when blades come out, so does the mountain beneath his smile.

#### Name: Serana Vale – Oathbow Guard of the High Crest  
Description: Calm and confident, Serana sees everything — and remembers it. Assigned to Lord Solmere’s escort for her skill and sharp intuition, she favors quiet conversation over brooding silence, often pointing out things others miss with a touch of dry humor. She’s friendly enough, but always alert. Her custom bow bears the markings of an old vow, though she won’t say to whom. She’s not mysterious — just measured.

  

### 🧑‍🌾 Settlement NPCs (Visitors)

#### Name: Harben Crick – Wagon Driver of the Low Road  
Description: Wrinkled from sun and sarcasm, Harben’s been driving supply wagons since before most folks were born. He talks to his mule more than people, and both seem to know when trouble’s coming. With a crooked grin, a broad hat, and boots older than some villages, Harben rolls through danger like it’s just another pothole. He keeps a crossbow tucked under the seat and swears he hasn’t missed since the Goblin Mudslide of ’19.

#### Name: Jaska Dellthorn – Spearhand of the Freightward  
Description: Jaska is tall, lean, and as sharp as the spear she sleeps beside. Once a city watchwoman, now hired guard, she keeps her hair braided tight and her eyes tighter. She doesn’t drink, doesn’t joke, and doesn’t miss. Her armor’s worn but polished, her posture ramrod straight, and her temper... short. She doesn’t mind the road — it’s the people that test her.

#### Name: Danner Holt – Shield-for-Hire
Description: Danner’s got the build of a barrel and the brain of a chess player. He wears a battered chain shirt under a traveler’s coat and carries a round shield covered in knife nicks and doodles. He hums when he’s nervous, tells bad jokes when it’s quiet, and throws hands when words fail. A good man in a fight, a better one around a fire. Once took a goblin javelin to the thigh and said, “That all you got?” They had more. He still walked it off.
