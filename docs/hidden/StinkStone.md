**StinkStone Clanhold — Region Writeup for DMs**

---

### Overview

**Location Name:** StinkStone  
**Region Type:** Resource Node / Fortified Goblin Enclave  
**Primary Resource:** Anthracite Coal (and rare essence-infused "Blackfire Stones")  
**Racial Occupants:** Fire-Essence Goblins of the StinkStone Clan  
**Geography:** Artificial hill complex composed of mined coal mounds and reinforced tunnels

---

### Regional Description

Generations ago, a tribe of goblins discovered a vein of coal-rich stone within a lonely hill near the eastern fringe of the Marrowfen frontier. They tunneled deep, hollowing out vast chambers and passageways. What began as a single den has, over time, become a dark and radiant fortress — **StinkStone**, named for the acrid reek of ever-burning coal.

Rather than haul the coal away to sell, the goblins dragged it out by the bucket and piled it in great mounds, building four new artificial hills surrounding the original. Over decades, they connected these hills with walls of packed, smoldering coal, gradually forming a jagged black ring — part citadel, part furnace.

The goblins of StinkStone have lived and bred among coal and fire for so long that they have become something more than goblin — **not magical, but infused with the essence of flame itself**. They are born of smoke, soot, and heat, and fire bends to their will like clay to a sculptor’s hand.

### Terrain Features

- **The Coal Hills**: Towering mounds of anthracite, compacted by generations of goblin traffic. Hard to climb and always warm to the touch.
- **Walls of Black Flame**: Ramparts of coal laced with heat channels. When threatened, goblins ignite these walls to create impassable sheets of fire.
- **Smoke Veins**: Thin chimneys vent smoke from below. These are both functional (for airflow) and tactical (they can release choking gas during a siege).
- **The Ember Pit**: Deep within the original hill lies a sacred pit of living flame, tended by BlackStone himself. It is both a religious site and a wellspring of their essence.
- **The Sparkling Vault**: A chamber curated by SparkleStone filled with rare and radiant minerals — particularly fire-touched stones and faintly glowing "starcoal" fragments.

### Inhabitants

#### **The StinkStone Goblins**

- Appear soot-darkened, often with glowing eyes or ember-like veins.
- Immune to fire.
- Can create and manipulate flame instinctively: lighting torches, igniting oil, hurling flame.
- This is **not spellcasting** and cannot be countered or dispelled. It is _essence_ — inherent, primal.
- Socially, they are tribal, loyal, and fiercely defensive of their home.
- **Defensive Tactic**: When under attack, goblins retreat into the tunnels and ignite the passageways behind them. The fires, which do not harm them, form blazing barriers that sear intruders and block pursuit. These inferno-lined paths are impassable to most foes and serve as a living moat of flame within their subterranean domain.
- **Weaponry and Armor**: The goblins forge weapons and shields from the anthracite itself, shaping it into obsidian-like blades and plates. Thanks to their essence, these weapons can ignite on their own without the need for oils or enchantments — spears, daggers, swords, and even arrows can burst into flame at a goblin’s will, searing flesh and lighting the battlefield ablaze.
- **Craftsmanship**: With anthracite as their chief material, the goblins have developed a rich tradition of coal-carving. They craft intricate figurines, tools, ceremonial masks, and statues from the hard, glassy coal — often inlaid with starcoal to add shimmering highlights or glowing accents.
#### **BlackStone – Chieftain of Flame**

- Stoic, hulking goblin who radiates heat like a furnace.
- His voice is slow and gravelly, with sparks in every breath.
- Reveres the Ember Pit as both ancestral altar and living entity.
- Believes outsiders are too brittle to understand true strength.
#### **SparkleStone – His Mate, Keeper of Shards**

- Intelligent, shrewd, and curious about the wider world.
- She alone trades with a few brave or clever outsiders.
- Wears jewelry forged from the fire-gems found in their mines.
- Holds influence with the young and ambitious within the clan.

---
### Story Hooks & Opportunities

- **Trade or Trouble**: Marrowfen seeks coal, but diplomacy is the only path. A failed approach risks drawing the wrath of fire-wielding warriors.
- **Gemstone Mystery**: The rare "Blackfire Stones" may be magical in nature — or cursed. Why do they only form here?
- **Something Deeper**: Whispers in the tunnels speak of a slumbering flame beneath even the Ember Pit — a heart of fire that beats still.
- **Clan Politics**: Not all goblins agree with BlackStone. Some want war. Others want trade. Players may tip the balance.
- **A Goblin Envoy**: A soot-covered goblin enters Marrowfen's local tavern and tries to pay for food and drink with a carved anthracite figurine — a goblin effigy with glowing starcoal eyes. This emissary, one of the curious young dissenters from StinkStone, seeks to open trade and gain fame. In exchange for being treated as a local celebrity for the night, the goblin offers a map to the coal enclave and instructions for safe approach.

---
### Travel & Approach

- **Visibility**: At night, the horizon glows dull red from the constant smoldering heat.
- **Smell**: A reek of coal, tar, and scorched earth carries for miles.
- **Caution**: Approaching the walls without invitation may trigger defensive firestorms from hidden flues and traps.

---
### DM Notes

- Treat the goblins’ fire abilities as **natural extensions** of their environment. They are not sorcerers, but creatures of elemental proximity.
- Combat here is deadly: the terrain itself fights back.
- Diplomatic players may gain powerful allies — or access to unique flame-touched materials.
- This region is ideal for Tier 2 or higher parties. Tier 1 players should be encouraged to parley, not provoke.

---

StinkStone is more than a mine — it's a living monument to survival, transformation, and the primal power of fire given form. Whether players seek trade, conquest, or understanding, they’ll find more than they bargained for in the glowing shadows of the coal hills.

## Trials

#### 🔥 **Trial of Flame and Ash**

> **Purpose:** To determine if outsiders are worthy of speaking with BlackStone as equals — not as beggars or merchants, but as those who _understand fire._

### 🪨 Format

**The Trial has three parts**, symbolizing what the goblins believe fire reveals:

1. **What You Can Endure (Survival)**
2. **What You Can Master (Control)**
3. **What You Will Burn (Conviction)**

---

### 🔥 1. **The Ember Walk**

**Test of Endurance & Pain**

- Players must walk across a trench of glowing anthracite coals barefoot (or otherwise exposed). Magic that _negates_ damage is **banned**; pain must be accepted to prove resilience.
- Fire damage is real — but non-lethal.
- _SparkleStone watches carefully to see who grits through it, and who shies away._

> **Design Notes:**  
> Add flavor like fire spirits whispering doubt, or glowing embers that respond to resolve.

---

### 🔥 2. **The Flamebind**

**Test of Control & Will**

- Each participant is handed a **living coal** — a chunk of fire essence.
- They must **ignite** a nearby sculpture or weapon using only this ember and their own control (roleplay, spell flavor, or skills like Sleight of Hand, Arcana, or even raw force of will).
- Those who panic or fail may spark uncontrolled flame — and must put it out _themselves_.
- SparkleStone judges this part closely.

> **Design Notes:**  
> This is about **deliberate fire**, not rage or destruction. Creative solutions are rewarded.

---

### 🔥 3. **The Ash Oath**

**Test of Conviction & Sacrifice**

- Each participant must choose **one thing to burn** — a possession, token, or object of value.
- This isn't a trick. The goblins _respect those who give up something real_ to prove they're not manipulators.
- The offering is placed in the **Ember Pit** before BlackStone.

> **Design Notes:**  
> This is where player roleplay and emotion shine. BlackStone will respect this moment most of all.

---

### 🧠 Outcomes & Interpretation

- **Pass All 3:** The party earns the right to speak as equals. BlackStone listens — _still cautious, but open._ SparkleStone may speak privately with them later, showing interest.
- **Pass 2/3:** They may be granted temporary audience but must earn more trust through deeds.
- **Fail 2+ or mock the ritual:** Considered unworthy. The goblins will not attack unless provoked — but they _will not help._
