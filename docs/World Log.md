#### 5/31/25 - Ashes to Assets (Session Run 1)
**Description**
> The players followed the tracks of **CharScrap**, a flame-touched goblin with a trader‚Äôs heart, back to their ancestral home: the anthracite keep of **StinkStone**.  
>  
> **Twitch Fox** and **Feather** each made donations of coin and goods to help support Marrowfen‚Äôs growth ‚Äî small acts with big impact for a budding settlement.
> 
> There, they met with **BlackStone**, the clan‚Äôs imposing chief, and **SparkleStone**, his sharp-witted mate, seeking to establish a trade agreement and alliance between **Marrowfen** and the fire-born goblins.  
>  
> After completing a series of trials ‚Äî symbolic in nature, yet deeply meaningful to the clan ‚Äî and negotiating with the dark monarch himself, an agreement was struck.  
>  
> **Grace** impressed SparkleStone with their control over flame and earned a rare gift: a handful of **Blackfire Stones**, or **Starcoal**, for future research (*in-world only*).  
>  
> **Viktora** refrained from killing anyone and stylishly bunny-hopped across hot coals, proving that they are willing and able to feel the flame to reach the desired outcome.  
>  
> **Feather** offered a deeply personal sacrifice to the **Ember Pit** ‚Äî a gesture of such sincerity it nearly broke the DM.  
>  
> When told they needed to *‚Äúspeak to the flame,‚Äù* Grace cast *Comprehend Languages*. There was a whisper in an unknown tongue. The stone said:  
> *‚ÄúI know not your words, but I know your warmth...‚Äù*  
> ‚Äî and then enhanced their *Firebolt*. The anthracite statue holding the candle cracked and glowed, mirroring the fire goblins themselves.  
>  
> The final agreement: **one wagonload of coal**, given freely, in return for **ten percent of ‚Äúeverything the heat of that coal touches‚Äù** ‚Äî a symbolic gesture more than a literal tithe.  
> It also includes a **mutual defense pact**: the clan will come to Marrowfen‚Äôs aid in times of need, just as Marrowfen is bound to answer the clan‚Äôs call.
>  
> The session closed with discussions of **irrigation** and **sustainable farming**. Grace may yet return with a full guide for making the land bloom.
> 
> **Grace** also persuaded **Thorn Barrow** to give the goblins a chance ‚Äî suggesting that the StinkStone clan may prove better in nature and intent than those he may have encountered in the past.
> 
> Twitch Fox left some stuff for the town:
 - Potion of Healing x3
> - Arrow x20
 - Torch x10
> - Ration x20
 - Oil x3
> - Hooded Lantern x1
 - Dagger x5
> - Cold Weather Clothing x2
 - Alchemist Fire x3
> - Blasting Powder x3
 - Chalk x1
> - Shield x1
 - 20x Platinum
>
> Feather left some stuff for the town:
 - 45 Arrows
> - Shortbow
 - 5 Keoghtom's Ointment
> - 3 Elixir of Health
 - Handaxe
> - 5 flasks of Oil
 - 3 Dust of Disappearance 
> - 5 Rations (Dried meats for the tavern until she can get more hunting.)
> - and 8 gold pieces in a pouch

##### üîç **Unexpected Developments (For Future Attention)**

- The **Starcoal... speaks?** Whether it whispers truths, warnings, or just crackles in a convincing way remains unclear.  
- Turns out **Starcoal may have uses** in alchemy, enchantment, or strange magical reactions. Grace has a sample, and curiosity is a fire all its own.  
- The **Marrowfen pine tree** has unexpectedly become a symbol of home for the settlers. No one‚Äôs sure if it‚Äôs thriving‚Ä¶ or adapting.  
- The town‚Äôs three horses now have names: **Dusty**, **Willow**, and **Bran**.
