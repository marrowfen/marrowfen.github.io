> [!summary]- 5/18/25 - Marrowfen – Test Run: Settling In
> On 05/18/2025, during the session **"Test Run: Settling In,"** the characters Arteme, Larient, Bryan Ragnarok, Generosity, and Massiah Omega gathered resources and cleared land. The resources collected included wood, stone, and reeds. No world change occurred as a result of this session.

> [!summary]- 5/22/25 - Marrowfen – Test Run: Crossing Over
> On 05/22/2025, during the session **"Test Run: Crossing Over,"** the characters Bryan Ragnarok, Grush, Vespa, Damian, and Massiah Omega gathered resources, cleared land, and began construction on a bridge. They successfully defended against an Orc invasion. Resources collected included wood, stone, clay, and copper ore. As a result, villagers completed or began construction on several buildings: a bridge, a tavern, and a stable. The tavern was named _**The Starry Crossing**_. Orcs are not expected to return unless provoked.

> [!summary]- 5/31/25 - Ashes to Assets (Session Run 1)
> The players followed the tracks of **CharScrap**, a flame-touched goblin with a trader’s heart, back to their ancestral home: the anthracite keep of **StinkStone**.  
>  
> **Twitch Fox** and **Feather** each made donations of coin and goods to help support Marrowfen’s growth — small acts with big impact for a budding settlement.
> 
> There, they met with **BlackStone**, the clan’s imposing chief, and **SparkleStone**, his sharp-witted mate, seeking to establish a trade agreement and alliance between **Marrowfen** and the fire-born goblins.  
>  
> After completing a series of trials — symbolic in nature, yet deeply meaningful to the clan — and negotiating with the dark monarch himself, an agreement was struck.  
>  
> **Grace** impressed SparkleStone with their control over flame and earned a rare gift: a handful of **Blackfire Stones**, or **Starcoal**, for future research (*in-world only*).  
>  
> **Viktora** refrained from killing anyone and stylishly bunny-hopped across hot coals, proving that they are willing and able to feel the flame to reach the desired outcome.  
>  
> **Feather** offered a deeply personal sacrifice to the **Ember Pit** — a gesture of such sincerity it nearly broke the DM.  
>  
> When told they needed to *“speak to the flame,”* Grace cast *Comprehend Languages*. There was a whisper in an unknown tongue. The stone said:  
> *“I know not your words, but I know your warmth...”*  
> — and then enhanced their *Firebolt*. The anthracite statue holding the candle cracked and glowed, mirroring the fire goblins themselves.  
>  
> The final agreement: **one wagonload of coal**, given freely, in return for **ten percent of “everything the heat of that coal touches”** — a symbolic gesture more than a literal tithe.  
> It also includes a **mutual defense pact**: the clan will come to Marrowfen’s aid in times of need, just as Marrowfen is bound to answer the clan’s call.
>  
> The session closed with discussions of **irrigation** and **sustainable farming**. Grace may yet return with a full guide for making the land bloom.
> 
> **Grace** also persuaded **Thorn Barrow** to give the goblins a chance — suggesting that the StinkStone clan may prove better in nature and intent than those he may have encountered in the past.
> 
> **Twitch Fox** left some stuff for the town: Potion of Healing x3, Arrow x20, Torch x10, Ration x20, Oil x3, Hooded Lantern x1, Dagger x5, Cold Weather Clothing x2, Alchemist Fire x3, Blasting Powder x3, Chalk x1, Shield x1, 20x Platinum
>
> **Feather** left some stuff for the town: 45 Arrows, Shortbow, 5 Keoghtom's Ointment, 3 Elixir of Health, Handaxe, 5 flasks of Oil, 3 Dust of Disappearance , 5 Rations (Dried meats for the tavern until she can get more hunting.), and 8 gold pieces in a pouch
> 
> ##### 🔍 **Unexpected Developments (For Future Attention)**
> - The **Starcoal... speaks?** Whether it whispers truths, warnings, or just crackles in a convincing way remains unclear.  
>- Turns out **Starcoal may have uses** in alchemy, enchantment, or strange magical reactions. Grace has a sample, and curiosity is a fire all its own.  
>- The **Marrowfen pine tree** has unexpectedly become a symbol of home for the settlers. No one’s sure if it’s thriving… or adapting.  
>- The town’s three horses now have names: **Dusty**, **Willow**, and **Bran**.
