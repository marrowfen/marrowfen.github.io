## Welcome to Marrowfen

***Marrowfen*** is a living, player-driven ***county*** designed for one-shot adventures set in a rugged, evolving frontier. Located along a river in a wetland forest, ***Marrowfen*** began as little more than a muddy trail, a few tents, and a dream. Every session changes the world - literally. Forests may burn, rivers may be bridged, and villages may rise from the soil with the work of adventurers like you.

Whether you're fighting off bandits, securing trade routes, forging new alliances, or clearing ancient ruins, your actions leave lasting marks. You might broker peace with goblins over a rich coal vein, or defend a caravan trail from hungry beasts. Maps update. Structures rise. Stories build.

But remember: the world moves on with or without you. Focus on securing a gold mine while ignoring safety, and you may return to find the village in ruins. ***Marrowfen*** thrives or suffers by the priorities its people choose.

##  What is Marrowfen?
- A living setting - shaped by players over time 
- Home to Tier 2 one-shots - each designed for 4–6 players, 4–5+ hours
- A mix of combat, social, exploration, and building missions
- A place where adventurers can leave a legacy, even if they never return

A dynamic world where neglect has consequences — and no choice is neutral

## How It Works
- Each adventure updates the map and world state
- Players may build, defend, or explore — but ignoring problems can cause them to grow
- You can return as the same character or someone new — Marrowfen remembers
- Your absence can open doors... or leave them unguarded**
